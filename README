This project is based on the iPhone Application NetIO Controller ( http://itunes.apple.com/app/netio/id464924297?mt=8 ) which uses a JSON structure to build a custom remote control for Arduino Boards, AVR-Net-IO Boards or other Hardware devices which are able to receive simple strings. 

This widget takes such a configuration and builds a working user interface into your dashboard!

More information about the configuration and the app (with demo video) can be found at http://netio.davideickhoff.de

The project is a very basic implementation and needs to be improved. Feel free to checkout and edit!

Installation:
- checkout repository
- change the hardcoded IP and Port (JSON connection settings are not used for now)
- build the widget with Dashcode
- add it to your dashboard
- set the path to your json file in the widget preferences (click on the small i-icon on the bottom right)

TODO:
- render labels
- use json connection settings
- fix image stretching
- use whole sends-array (currently just the first is being sent)
- implement reads functionality
